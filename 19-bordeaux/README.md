# A simple cure to the p < 0.05 disease

In this talk, I will argue that there is no replicability crisis, just a collection of bad habits and wrong expectations from all involved in the research enterprise. The main habit is the use of P values and confidence intervals to dichotomise results as “significant” or “not significant”. This habit stems from poor training in statistics and unrealistic expectations about our research methods. The cure to the dichotomy madness involves important steps:
- to provide clear definitions;
- to embrace measurement uncertainty;
- to understand the difficulty in assessing theories;
- to accept that no single experiment can establish a new phenomenon;
- to match statistical tools to empirical questions, instead of following the herd.
